Absolutely! We can create a **single script** that will handle a full rebuild of your project — cleaning, installing the right dependencies, building `tweeter-shared` and `tweeter-web`, and making sure VS Code picks up everything properly.

Here’s a script you can use on **Windows (Git Bash)** or macOS/Linux:

---

### 1️⃣ Create a file called `rebuild.sh` in your project root:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "💡 Cleaning node_modules and lock files..."
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
rm -rf tweeter-web/node_modules tweeter-web/package-lock.json
rm -rf tweeter-shared/node_modules tweeter-shared/package-lock.json

echo "💡 Installing shared dependencies..."
npm install

echo "💡 Installing correct versions in tweeter-shared..."
cd tweeter-shared
npm install
echo "💡 Building tweeter-shared..."
npm run build
cd ..

echo "💡 Installing correct versions in tweeter-web..."
cd tweeter-web
npm install
# Ensure the right versions for React, TS, and type definitions
npm install react@18 react-dom@18 react-router-dom@6.14.0 react-infinite-scroll-component@6.1.0
npm install --save-dev typescript@5 @types/react@18 @types/react-dom@18
echo "💡 Building tweeter-web..."
npm run build
cd ..

echo "✅ Rebuild complete!"
echo "Tip: Run 'npm start' inside tweeter-web to launch the app."
```

---

### 2️⃣ Make it executable (macOS/Linux)

```bash
chmod +x rebuild.sh
```

On Windows (Git Bash), you can just run it with `bash rebuild.sh`.

---

### 3️⃣ Usage

Whenever you want a **fresh, clean rebuild**:

```bash
bash rebuild.sh
```

It will:

1. Clean all `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`.
2. Install all dependencies in the root, `tweeter-shared`, and `tweeter-web`.
3. Build `tweeter-shared` first.
4. Build `tweeter-web` with the correct React, TS, and InfiniteScroll versions.
5. Leave the project ready to run with `npm start`.

---

If you want, I can also make a **Windows-only `.cmd` version** that works perfectly in Command Prompt without Git Bash.

Do you want me to do that?
